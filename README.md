# Sourcemod Translation Site

[ ![Codeship Status for webdestroya/sourcemod-translator](https://www.codeship.io/projects/80b437e0-82d3-0131-3171-3e041e14c86b/status?branch=master)](https://www.codeship.io/projects/14895)

This application provides a web based interface for multiple users to collaboratively work on translating plugin files.

## Translating to Sourcemod Translator

- Edit the translations directly on the [sourcemod-translator](http://www.localeapp.com/projects/public?search=sourcemod-translator) project on Locale.
- **That's it!**
- The maintainer will then pull translations from the Locale project and push to Github.

Happy translating!
